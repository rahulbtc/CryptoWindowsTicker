# CryptoWindowsTicker
A CryptoCurrency Ticker, which will run on top of Rainmeter. Go to https://www.rainmeter.net/   and download the latest release, and install rainmeter.exe. 

After that, download this: Cryptoticker_v 2.0.rmskin package, and double click, open with rainmeter.

And that's it! It should work.

Thanks to CoinGecko and Alternative for providing their APIs for public access.

Known issue/bug:
sometimes, there can be a second bracket after the end of the price, mainly because I hardcoded the webparser string :P
I was a bit lazy to figure out what to do.

This was my hobby project, and I did it just because I wanted a custom ticker, and it's working as I expected.
If you catch the bug and figure out, feel free to let me know. I'll update. :)

Also, feel free to modify the code as per your needs. You can go to -> Rainmeter -> Manage -> Select the crypto windows ticker -> Edit. 
A Notepad will open with the code, so feel free to edit it if you want. If you mess up, delete the widget, and download again from here.
